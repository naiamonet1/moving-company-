# moving-company-
You’ve recently founded your own moving and storage company, and bought a moving truck as well. The service you offer is picking up items from customers’ homes and storing them in your warehouse. The unique part of your service is that it’s on-demand — customers can request a pickup at any time, and those requests will enter a queue within your system. When a customer enters a request, you see how far they live west or east of your warehouse, and how many cubic feet their belongings take up. Your teammate helps you out by sending you the next request on the list, whenever you ask for it.
